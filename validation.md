# üß™ Validation & Scoring Standards

This document provides comprehensive, science-based validation details for each diet-quality index implemented in the **Dietary Index Web Calculator**. It includes calculation methods, reference sources, expected ranges, and validation strategies.
All algorithms mirror the reference implementation in the [`dietaryindex` R package](https://jamesjiadazhan.github.io/dietaryindex_manual/index.html), and regression tests compare our outputs to the validation datasets documented in that manual.

## 1. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)
**Purpose:** Quantify the inflammatory potential of a diet.
**Range:** ‚àí8.87 (most anti-inflammatory) to +7.98 (most pro-inflammatory).
**Units:** Dimensionless score normalized to world-standard intake.

### 1.1 Calculation
1. **Literature-derived parameters** for 45 food parameters (e.g., nutrients, flavonoids).
- **Validation dataset**: `DII_validation_result.csv` replicates the R manual example and matches scores to within ¬±0.01 after rounding.

- **Validation dataset**: pending; see the R manual for summary statistics and expected distributions.

- **Validation dataset**: `HEI2015_VALIDATION.csv` cross-checks against NIH SAS code; values agree to two decimal places.

## 4. DASH Score
**Purpose:** Quantify adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet.
**Range:** 8 (lowest) to 40 (highest).
**Units:** Sum of component quintile-based scores.

### 4.1 Calculation (Fung et al. method)
1. **8 components**: Fruits, vegetables (excl. potatoes), whole grains, low-fat dairy, nuts/legumes, sodium, red/processed meats, sweetened beverages.
2. **Cohort-specific quintiles**: Assign 1‚Äì5 points for adequacy components (highest quintile = 5) and reverse for moderation components (lowest quintile = 5).
3. **Total** = Œ£ component scores (range 8‚Äì40).

### 4.2 References

- **Validation dataset**: `DASH_VALIDATION.csv` derived from the R manual; quintile cut points reproduce the example results.

- **Validation dataset**: `AHEI_VALIDATION.csv` replicates the manuals example results for all 11 components.

- **Validation dataset**: `AHEIP_VALIDATION.csv` ensures parity with the serving-based algorithm described in the manual.

- **Validation dataset**: `MED_VALIDATION.csv` provides sample inputs yielding identical scores to the manual.

- **Validation dataset**: `MEDI_V2_validation.csv` matches PREDIMED cut points as documented in the manual.

- **Validation dataset**: `HEI2020_VALIDATION.csv` and `HEI2020_V2_VALIDATION.csv` reproduce the manuals adult and toddler examples.

- **Validation dataset**: `PHDI_VALIDATION.csv` and `PHDI_V2_VALIDATION.csv` verify consistency with the manual's examples.
- **Validation dataset**: `ACS2020_V1_validation.csv` and `ACS2020_V2_validation.csv` reproduce the manual's quartile-based scoring.
_Note: As of 2025‚Äë06‚Äë28 only the DII module has been fully benchmarked against real datasets. The remaining scores are ported from the R package but await comprehensive validation files._

- **Per-component scoring**: 0 (lowest), 0.5 (medium), 1 (highest) based on weekly consumption thresholds.
- **Total score**: Sum across components, e.g.,
  ```text
  Score = Œ£_{healthy} (servings ‚â• threshold ? 1 : servings in medium range ? 0.5 : 0)
        + Œ£_{unhealthy} (servings ‚â§ threshold ? 1 : servings in medium range ? 0.5 : 0)
  ```

  \[
    component\ score =
    egin{cases}
      max\ score & intake ‚â• standard_{max} \
      (intake / standard_{max}) √ó max\ score & standard_{min} < intake < standard_{max} \
      0 & intake ‚â§ standard_{min}
    \end{cases}
  \]

- **Total HEI‚Äë2015** = Œ£ component scores.

## üöß Implementation Note (2025‚Äë06‚Äë28)

The web UI now tries to compute **all** four diet indices automatically when the
necessary columns are present. Only the DII calculation has been validated with
real data so far. MIND, HEI‚Äë2015, and DASH still need dedicated input datasets
and benchmark results. Once those resources are available, revisit this logic
and confirm the implementations.
**Purpose:** Quantify adherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet.
**Common Range:** 8 (lowest adherence) to 40 (highest adherence).
**Units:** Sum of component quintile-based scores.

### 4.1 Calculation (Fung et al. method)
1. **8 components**: Fruits, vegetables (excl. potatoes), whole grains, low-fat dairy, nuts/legumes, sodium, red/processed meats, sweetened beverages.
2. **Cohort-specific quintiles**: Assign 1‚Äì5 points for each adequacy component (highest quintile =¬†5) and reverse for moderation components (lowest quintile =¬†5).
3. **Total** = Œ£ component scores (range¬†8‚Äì40).

## üìã Validation Workflow

1. **Unit tests**: Compare outputs to gold-standard datasets (`tests/data/`).
2. **Statistical checks**: Ensure score distributions match published summary statistics.
3. **End-to-end**: CSV ‚Üí API ‚Üí JSON & CSV outputs validated against expected ranges.
4. **Visualization**: Plotly histograms & boxplots match known population distributions.
