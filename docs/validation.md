# Validation Summary

This page links to the detailed scientific references and methods used to verify each diet-quality index. Reference datasets live in the `data/` directory and are exercised automatically via the pre-commit hook. Install requirements first with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For the full write-up see
[../validation.md](../validation.md). The Rust crate reuses these datasets in its own tests.
Additional lookup tables are available in [scoring_algorithms.md](scoring_algorithms.md) and [serving_sizes.md](serving_sizes.md).
