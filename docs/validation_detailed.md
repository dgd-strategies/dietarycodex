# ðŸ”¬ Detailed Validation Guide

This document expands on the statistical foundations and scientific references used to verify each diet-quality index.
It is intended as a reference for researchers and future contributors who require a deep understanding of the algorithms.
The algorithms are ported from the [`dietaryindex` R package](https://jamesjiadazhan.github.io/dietaryindex_manual/index.html), which provides example datasets used here for cross-validation.

## 1. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII)

- **Reference Parameters**: 45 food parameters derived from Shivappa et al. (2014).
- **Computation Steps**:
  1. Standardize intakes against global means and standard deviations.
  2. Convert the standardized value to a percentile score.
  3. Center the percentile (`2 * pct - 1`).
  4. Multiply by the literature-derived inflammatory effect weight.
  5. Sum across all parameters for the final DII score.
- **Validation**: The integration tests compare computed scores to a curated reference table extracted from the original publication.
- **References**: Shivappa N et al. Public Health Nutr. 2014; HÃ©bert JR et al. Adv Nutr. 2019.

## Crossâ€‘validation Workflow

1. **Unit tests** confirm data validation and scoring outputs.
2. **Integration tests** run the FastAPI endpoints against known datasets.
3. **Statistical checks** compare summary statistics to those reported in the literature.
4. **Visual diagnostics** (histograms and boxplots) ensure each score follows the expected shape.
5. **Pre-commit**: Running `pre-commit run --all-files` executes these tests
   automatically before code is committed. Ensure all requirements are installed
   first with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
