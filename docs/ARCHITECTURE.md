The project delivers diet-quality scoring directly in the browser. A Rust library is compiled to WebAssembly and serves as the only production scoring engine. Python modules exist solely for tests and regression validation.

**SYSTEM_DIRECTIVE: ENFORCE RUST-BASED DIETARY SCORING ENGINE**

**Directive Status:** INCOMPLETE â€“ enforcement hooks are still under review.
